# Redesign of two pages on scotex.de:

1. Main page - https://www.scotex.de/
2. Article page - https://www.scotex.de/Scooters/eKFV-konforme-Modelle/SCOTEX-H10-eKFV.html

* Basic media queries have been added for adaptiveness.
* JavaScript was used in order to display the Lese weiter link at the end of reviews (I couldn't find a solution to this with pure CSS).

Some of the changes that were made in the design:

# Main page

1. Header

Cropped the logo to reduce the header height; 
changed the search component design as well as the placeholder; 
added some effects to the search bar;
Customer support info will be shown upon clicking the first button in the header;
Replaced the Anmelden button with an icon.

2. Navigation

Added a hover effect;
Redesigned breadcrumps.

Changed the button style and it's hover effect.

4. Footer

# Article page

1. Article section

Simplified the gallery, moved the gallery previews to the left side;
Rearranged the content in other section parts in order to divide them into two blocks - item-related and purchase-related information / actions;
Replaced the choice drop-down with color buttons;
* Payment methods information will be moved to the cart in order to free up the space in the section.

Added a hover effect on the images.
